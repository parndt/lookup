Really freakin' quick lookup for terminal

To use it:
ruby lookup.rb ActiveRecord::Base#new

If two methods are returned it will show both:
ruby lookup.rb ActiveRecord::Base#destroy

You can abbreviate constants:
ruby lookup.rb ARec#new 
And then it will whine at you for not being specific enough (threshold is 20)

So you abbreviate it not so much:
ruby lookup.rb ARecB#new
And then it will show you the api link for the new method.

You can also abbreviate method names:
ruby lookup.rb distance_of_time_in_words_to_now
can become:
ruby lookup.rb dotiwtn


Give it a shot!
